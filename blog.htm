  <h1 class="blog-title">Why I Left L&T – The Untold Story</h1>

  <p>Hey guys, I’m <strong>Jugal Pakhare</strong> and I’m going to share my very first blog with you. Through this post, I aim to unlock and answer many questions that people often ask me—especially the big one: <strong>Why did I leave L&T, one of India’s largest and most prestigious conglomerates, during my DET (Diploma Engineer Trainee) training phase?</strong></p>

  <p>Many people created rumors, some assumed their own theories, but the truth was always buried—and today, I’m going to clear it all. Yes, L&T is a big brand. Many engineering students dream of working there. Even I did. But dreams don’t always match reality, and here’s why.</p>

  <p>As long as I survived in the company, a part of me remained broken. Every time someone asked me why I left, I gave diplomatic answers—but today, I want to be raw, real, and reflective. There wasn’t just one reason for my departure; there were many. Some were personal, some circumstantial, and others were deeply rooted in the company’s system.</p>

  <p>But let me say this before we dive deeper: <strong>L&T didn’t just give me grief or hardship. It gave me some unforgettable moments, amazing exposure, and a real taste of corporate life.</strong> For that, I’ll always remain thankful. One day, I’ll write another blog dedicated solely to my L&T journey—from orientation to resignation. But for now, let’s stick to the real talk: <strong>Why I left.</strong></p>

  <p>The purpose of this blog isn’t to offend anyone or hurt sentiments. It’s simply to clarify doubts, burst myths, and share my experience of working in the construction industry, hoping someone out there benefits from my story.</p>

  <h2>1. No Room for Higher Studies</h2>
  <p>L&T doesn’t allow trainees to pursue full-time courses. During the training period, you can’t opt for any degree. Even after DET training, the company doesn’t sponsor your degree unless you’ve completed two years and received high ratings from your immediate supervisor. And that too, only part-time degrees from Tier-1 colleges—and I haven’t seen anyone actually do this in my network.</p>
  <p>Let’s face it: In today’s world, just a diploma won’t take you far. You’ll probably end up as a technician. For higher roles, government exams, and civil services, a full-time degree is essential. L&T allows you to study part-time, but come on—what kind of degree is that? It’s not respected like a full-time course. Plus, with 12-hour shifts and strict leave policies, attending classes or exams becomes nearly impossible.</p>
  <p>Some people even take admission to Tier-3 colleges as full-time students while working in L&T—by convincing the college. But let’s be real: That’s shady, borderline illegal, and might cause serious issues in your future career.</p>

  <h2>2. No Scope for Promotion</h2>
  <p>Your career graph at L&T is tied to how much your senior likes you. Your growth depends less on your skills and more on your rating—which your senior gives. Even if you behave ethically and work hard, it won’t matter unless your boss is satisfied with you.</p>
  <p>After DET training, you have to wait two more years for a minor promotion. And even then, your salary increase is around ₹5,000–₹10,000. That’s it! They show this big dream of becoming MD from DET, but in reality, DETs struggle even more than GETs to climb the ladder.</p>

  <h2>3. Worst Working Culture</h2>
  <p>This is a major reason I left. L&T sites are a living example of how weak Indian labor laws are. 12-hour shifts were never mentioned in my offer letter. And guess what? No weekly holidays. Just a rest day after two weeks—and that too, used as a buffer to rotate from day to night shifts. Public holidays? Festivals? National holidays? Forget it. Getting leave for personal reasons was a nightmare. They only gave holidays when labor refused to work, like on Holi.</p>
  <p>Even on these days, EHS department staff were asked to keep checking the site.</p>

  <h2>4. Lack of Professionalism</h2>
  <p>At L&T, your respect depends on your cadre. If you’re third-party staff or RSW, you’re basically invisible. DETs are treated like free labor. I was in EHS and when I reported an issue, my superior responded, “Tum bahot chhote cadre ke ho, dusre steward ko bolo.”</p>
  <p>Also, I’m a Marathi guy posted in North India—I once referred to a senior as "Sharma Ji." He shouted, “Tumhara cadre dekho aur mera dekho, Sharma Sir bolo.”</p>
  <p>That moment was humiliating. Abuse from seniors was common. If you want to survive as a site engineer, you must learn to tolerate it—and pass it down. WhatsApp groups were full of fights between EHS, P&M, and execution staff. There was zero teamwork. It felt like a modern-day <em>varna system</em> in corporate form.</p>

  <h2>5. Worst Working Environment</h2>
  <p>I don’t know about other sites, but mine was a disaster. No drinking water. No toilets. No food. Not even a cup of tea for 12 hours. Seriously—Hitler wasn’t this cruel.</p>
  <p>Night shift? No break. And though the offer letter mentioned company-provided transportation, every time I called the driver, I was met with abuse and excuses. Complaining got me nowhere. They’d say, “Site hai, thoda sehna padta hai.”</p>
  <p>Even when water was provided, it was from unhygienic wells. No EHS testing was ever done. Laborers at the steel yard worked in 45°C heat with no shelter. And this has been going on for years.</p>

  <h2>6. Lack of Future Scope</h2>
  <p>Even after promotions, your work, environment, and shift timings remain unchanged. You can't customize your future. You’re stuck in a loop—and that wasn’t acceptable for me.</p>

  <p>There are many other reasons—but I’ll share them when the time is right. For now, I just wanted to clear the air, answer your questions, and share the truth.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you for reading.</strong> And stay tuned—I’ll be back with another blog detailing my full L&T experience, from the day I joined till the day I resigned. Until then, take care and stay true to your path.</p>
