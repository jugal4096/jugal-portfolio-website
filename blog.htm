    <h1 class="blog-title">Why I Left L&T – The Untold Truth Behind My Exit</h1>
    <p><strong>By Jugal Pakhare</strong></p>

    <p>Ever since my departure from L&T, many created rumors and their own theories. But today, I want to share the truth. L&T is one of the biggest firms in India, and thousands of engineers dream of getting placed there. But dreams change when reality hits hard.</p>

    <h2>1) No Room for Higher Studies</h2>
    <p>L&T doesn’t allow DETs to pursue full-time higher studies. Even after training, company sponsorship depends on your ratings and manager’s recommendation. That too only for part-time degrees from tier-1 colleges — but I haven’t met a single employee who actually got that. </p>
    <p>Diploma is no longer sufficient in today’s competitive world. A degree is almost mandatory for better jobs or competitive exams. Company policy does allow employees to pursue part-time degrees, but such degrees are less valuable and difficult to manage due to 12-hour shifts and no proper leave system.</p>

    <h2>2) No Scope for Promotion</h2>
    <p>Promotion depends entirely on your supervisor’s recommendation, not merit. Even after getting promoted from DET, your salary increases by just ₹5–10K. DETs struggle more than GETs to rise, and the company’s promise of “DET to MD” seems like a hoax on the ground.</p>

    <h2>3) Worst Working Culture</h2>
    <p>L&T construction sites are a perfect example of poor labor law enforcement. 12-hour shifts, no weekly holidays, and zero flexibility on public or religious holidays. Holidays are given only when workers themselves refuse to work, like on Holi.</p>
    <p>Even then, EHS staff must patrol and monitor sites. It was exhausting, both mentally and physically.</p>

    <h2>4) Lack of Professionalism</h2>
    <p>Your cadre defines your respect level. As a trainee, I was treated like a petty worker. When I reported issues to my senior, I was told not to bother him due to my “lower cadre.” Calling someone “Sharma ji” led to a shouting session — I was ordered to say “Sharma Sir” because I was junior. Departments often fought among themselves in WhatsApp groups — a serious lack of coordination and teamwork.</p>

    <h2>5) Worst Working Environment</h2>
    <p>My site had no clean drinking water, no toilets, no meals — not even tea. In night shifts, no dinner breaks. Vehicles promised in offer letters never showed up. Water came from dirty bores, never tested by EHS. Workers toiled under 45°C with no shade. Complaints went unanswered. This wasn’t temporary — it went on for 2 years straight.</p>

    <h2>6) Lack of Future Scope</h2>
    <p>Even after promotion, your job, environment, and work shifts do not change. You can’t switch roles easily. There’s no long-term vision or path laid down for true career growth or self-development.</p>

    <h2>Gratitude and Closure</h2>
    <p>This doesn’t mean L&T gave me only pain. I’m thankful for the real-world experience and lessons I gained. I’ll soon publish a detailed blog about my journey — from joining, orientation, site life to resignation. But for now, this is about the reasons behind my exit.</p>

    <p>There are other personal and situational reasons too, but I’ll share them when the time is right.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To those who look up to corporate life, remember: Not every big brand gives you a big life. Your peace, growth, and dreams matter more. Thanks for reading. More coming soon.</p>
