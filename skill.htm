    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>I began my programming journey with Python, and it opened up a new world for me. Its simplicity and power helped me build a strong foundation in logic, problem-solving, and automation. From scripting to small applications, Python continues to be a language I enjoy experimenting with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
      <p>Designing websites using HTML and CSS is where my creativity thrives. I love crafting elegant, responsive layouts with a modern aesthetic—just like this portfolio! Every element I build helps me understand structure, responsiveness, and UI/UX better.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>SQL</h2>
      <p>SQL forms the backbone of my data-handling skills. I have confidently worked on complex queries and real-world projects like my <strong>Rail Finder Project</strong>, where I built a system to fetch and manage train data using relational database concepts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>C, C++, and Java</h2>
      <p>I’ve developed a strong command over structured and object-oriented programming through C, C++, and Java. These languages have sharpened my understanding of logic building, data structures, and memory management techniques.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
      <p>From process scheduling to memory management, I’ve delved into core concepts of Operating Systems, understanding how computers manage tasks efficiently—essential knowledge for any serious programmer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>Data Structures & Algorithms</h2>
      <p>DSA is the soul of efficient problem solving. I regularly practice coding problems to improve my grasp on arrays, trees, graphs, and algorithms. It’s a constant learning path that strengthens both interviews and real-world logic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>IoT</h2>
      <p>With the world moving toward smart devices, I’ve explored Internet of Things projects, understanding how sensors and microcontrollers interact with code and the internet to create intelligent systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="skill-block">
      <h2>DBMS</h2>
      <p>Database design and optimization are crucial in today’s software world. My knowledge of DBMS has helped me build structured systems like the <strong>Rail Finder Project</strong>, applying normalization, ER diagrams, and indexing for better performance.</p>
