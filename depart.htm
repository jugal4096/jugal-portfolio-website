<h1>💥 Why I Left L&T — Even Before Finishing DET Training</h1>

<p class="intro">
    Hey everyone, I’m Jugal Pakhare, and I’m super excited to share my first blog with you.

    Throughout this blog series, I’ll be diving deep into my personal and professional journey—answering the most common and sometimes uncomfortable questions people keep asking me. And today, I’m tackling the biggest one of all:
    
    "Bro, why did you leave L&T? That too during the DET training phase?"
    
    A totally valid question. I mean, who walks out on Larsen & Toubro—one of India’s biggest and most respected conglomerates—just months into their career?
    
    Well, buckle up, because I’m going to lay it all out: the why, the what, the hard truth, and what I’ve learned from it. This isn’t a rant. It’s a reflection. And maybe, just maybe, it’ll help someone out there who’s feeling the same confusion I once did.
    
    Let’s break it down.
    
</p>

<h2>🌪 The Rumours, The Theories & The Truth</h2>
<p>Ever since I walked away from L&T, I’ve heard all kinds of whispers—
    “Bro couldn’t handle corporate pressure...”
    “He got into trouble during training...”
    “He found something better maybe?”
    “Must’ve been a burnout...”
    Some even assumed I just gave up.
    
    Let’s be honest—people love drama more than facts. And when you leave a giant like Larsen & Toubro—especially while still in the DET (Diploma Engineer Trainee) phase—you become free real estate for gossip.
    
    But today, I’m done staying quiet. This blog isn’t about defending myself, it’s about telling the truth that got lost in the noise.
    
    Here’s the deal:
    Yes, L&T is a dream company for many. It’s one of India’s largest, most powerful engineering firms—with decades of legacy, unmatched infrastructure projects, and a strong brand name that shines on every resume. I was proud when I got placed. In college, it felt like I had “made it.” My family was proud. My peers looked at me differently. It was the golden ticket, or so I thought.
    
    But what most people don’t see behind the shiny offer letter is what actually goes on—the reality of the system, the inner conflicts, and the silent voice inside you asking:
    “Is this really where I belong?”
    
    And that’s where my story begins.
    </p>

<h2>💔 When The Dream Started To Crack</h2>
<p>As long as I was inside the system, my dream slowly started to fade—bit by bit, reality began replacing the excitement. What I once thought would be the launchpad of my engineering career, started to feel more like a cage.

    And every time someone asks me:
    “Why did you leave L&T?”
    My answer is always the same:
    “Not one, but many reasons.”
    
    Most people jump to conclusions.
    “Oh, it must be the toxic work culture!”
    And yes, let’s not sugarcoat it — the work culture was a major reason behind my decision. But let me be clear, it wasn’t the only reason.
    
    There were layers to my decision—some personal, some circumstantial, and some deeply internal. I wasn’t just running away from something…
    I was also trying to find something I had lost inside me.
    🎭 Not Just Sorrow — L&T Gave Me Moments I’ll Always Be Grateful For
    Let me make one thing very clear —
    Leaving L&T doesn’t mean the company only gave me grief and sorrow.
    Far from it.
    
    I received some truly unforgettable experiences at L&T — lessons that no classroom or college could ever teach me. From the day I joined, to the orientation, the first project meeting, and finally the last mail I sent before resigning — this journey was a rollercoaster. And trust me, it deserves a story of its own.
    
    Yes, I plan to write a dedicated blog where I’ll take you through the entire L&T chapter of my life — like a storybook. The people I met, the pressure I faced, the systems I learned, the small wins, the inner battles… everything. Because no matter what, L&T will always hold a distinct place in my journey, and I’ll always be thankful for the part it played in shaping me.
    
    But today, this post isn’t that story.
    This post is about something deeper — my why.
    
    The reasons I left L&T were not random or impulsive. They were reflective, they came from deep introspection, and above all, they were crucial for my future goals and personal growth.
    
    So now, let’s get real.
    Let’s talk about the reasons behind the decision that shocked many — but freed me
    </p>

<h2>🎭 Not Just Sorrow — L&T Gave Me Moments I’ll Always Be Grateful For</h2>
<p>Before I move ahead, let me say this loud and clear —
    This blog is not written to insult, blame, or target anyone.
    
    The real reason I decided to write this is simple:
    To clear doubts, bust a few myths, address some loud rumors, and most importantly — give people a little real-world exposure to how corporate life feels inside the construction and infrastructure sector.
    
    Too many people assumed my silence was guilt.
    But the truth is, I stayed silent because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s sentiments.
    But now I realise — some answers need to be revealed, because staying quiet only creates more noise.
    
    I’m here to share my own experience, from within the system.
    Not to generalize.
    Not to create controversy.
    But to simply say: This is how it was for me.
    
    And with that intention in heart,
    Let’s now dive into the real reasons behind why I left L&T — and why it was one of the most crucial decisions for my future.
    </p>

<h2>🚪 Reason 1: No Room for Higher Studies</h2>
<p>One of the biggest shocks after joining L&T was the realization that higher education is almost out of reach.

    As a DET (Diploma Engineer Trainee), you’re strictly not allowed to pursue any full-time educational course other than internal training — no matter how valuable it might be to your role or future career. And this ban continues even after training ends.
    
    Officially, after completing your DET program, the company might allow you to pursue a part-time degree — but here’s the real deal:
    
    You must wait at least two years,
    
    You need to have strong performance ratings,
    
    You must get recommendation from your supervisor,
    
    And still, there’s no guarantee the company will sponsor you.
    
    Even if they do, it’s only for part-time programs from Tier-1 colleges — but let me be honest:
    
    I haven’t met a single person who actually got into a Tier-1 college with L&T sponsorship.
    
    And that’s just the surface.
    
    Let’s be real — a diploma isn’t enough in today’s world. It might get you a technician role, but it won’t help you climb the ladder or compete in UPSC, state services, or most government exams.
    A proper degree is essential — not just for a career boost, but to keep multiple paths open.
    
    Yes, the company allows employees to pursue part-time degrees on their own. But seriously — how practical is that when you’re:
    
    Working 12-hour shifts,
    
    Dealing with rigid leave policies,
    
    And trying to manage classes, practicals, and exams all at once?
    I’ve seen people try to do “full-time” degrees from Tier-3 colleges while still working full-time at L&T — basically a degree on paper, with silent consent from the college.
    But for me?
    That felt unethical, unsafe, and unstable.
    
    I didn’t want to build my career on shortcuts or gray areas.
    
    I wanted real learning, real growth, and a real future.
    And unfortunately, in that environment — I couldn’t see it happening.
    
    
    
    
    
         </p>

<h2>📉 Reason 2: No Clear Scope for Promotion</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about the second harsh reality I faced —
Career growth was less about performance, and more about politics.

In traditional corporate life — and L&T was no different — your fate isn’t necessarily decided by your ethics, skills, or dedication.
It’s decided by one person:

Your immediate senior.

You could be the most disciplined, ethical, and hard-working engineer out there — but if you don’t satisfy your senior, forget about moving up. Your growth depends more on pleasing the hierarchy than on actual skill or impact.

Now look — I can accept that to some extent. That’s just how corporate chains work, and I knew that going in.

But the real letdown?

Even if you wait, behave, impress your boss, and finally get promoted — the reward is barely motivating.

For most DETs, there’s no promotion for at least 2 years after training ends. And when it finally comes?
Your salary increase is usually a measly ₹5,000–₹10,000.
That’s it.
From all the extra responsibilities, site pressure, targets, and expectations — that’s your “reward”.

And meanwhile, you’re running like a machine, chasing performance ratings, because that rating controls your life — leave, location, promotions, everything.

What’s worse?
The biggest hoax I heard in the company:

“Work hard and you can go from DET to MD.”

Seriously?

That line is fed to every batch of trainees like a motivational quote — but on the ground, it felt more like a fairy tale.

From what I observed, DETs had to struggle a lot more than GETs (Graduate Engineer Trainees) for even the basic steps in the ladder. We were treated like the bottom layer, expected to do the grunt work with minimal recognition.

So tell me —
When your efforts don’t match the outcomes, when your future depends on office politics, and when your growth is neither guaranteed nor worth it — why would I choose to stay stuck?

I wanted a career where hard work leads to real progress, not vague promises and salary slips that barely reflect my sweat.

</p>

<h2>⛓️ Reason 3: The Worst Working Culture</h2>
<p>Let’s not sugarcoat this —
    The working culture was one of the most painful and deciding factors behind my exit.
    If I had to name one brutal truth I learned at L&T sites, it would be this:
    Indian labour laws look good on paper — but on sites, they barely exist.
    
    The 12-hour shifts were the most intolerable and mentally exhausting part of the job.
    Before joining L&T, I had already made up my mind:
    
    "No job is worth working 12 hours a day."
    
    But guess what?
    
    Nowhere during my onboarding, offer, or orientation did anyone clearly mention this 12-hour shift policy. It was a silent trap.
    And once I reached the site, there was no way out — just accept it and suffer.
    No negotiation. No choice. No escape.
    
    But wait — it gets worse.
    
    There were no weekly holidays.
    Instead, you work like a machine — 14 days straight, and only then you’re allowed a shift “rotation” or short break. And when you question it, you're hit with this legendary dialogue from site management:
    
    “HQ walon ne to ye chhutti bhi dene ko nahi bola… hum log hi manage karte hain!”
    
    Excuse me?
    Do we owe you something?
    We’re working like machines under the sun, on dangerous sites, sacrificing time, energy, and health — and you act like basic holidays are a favour?
    
    There’s no public holiday,
    No national holiday,
    No religious holiday —
    Not even sick leave is respected without a series of explanations and tension from seniors.
    
    Want to go home for an emergency? Prepare to beg, explain, follow up, and still face rejection.
    
    You know what was even more shocking?
    
    On some festivals like Holi, when many labourers refused to work — only then the site felt “dead.” But even then, EHS staff were instructed to periodically inspect the site just to maintain pressure and control.
    
    So now tell me —
    
    Is this a job or a jail sentence?
    
    When an organisation starts normalising overwork, ignoring mental and physical health, and builds a culture of fear, not respect, then that’s not just a red flag —
    That’s a full-blown alarm.
    
    And for me, no brand name, no salary, and no promise of the future was worth trading my basic dignity and peace of mind.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    </p>

<h2>🧱 Reason 4: Lack of Professionalism</h2>
<p>This one deserves a spotlight of its own.
    Because beyond all the work hours, site pressure, and broken promises — the biggest disappointment I felt was this:
    
    There was no culture of respect — only a hierarchy of ego.
    
    At L&T, your cadre decided your value.
    Your designation wasn’t just your job — it became your identity.
    And if you were a third-party staff, RSW, or a trainee like me?
    
    Congratulations. You were basically treated like a petty, disposable extra.
    
    Let me give you a few real examples — no sugarcoating.
    
    I was posted in the EHS department.
    As a fresher trying to learn and understand, I once raised a genuine safety issue to my in-charge. Instead of guiding or acknowledging it, he told me:
    
    "Tum bahot chhote cadre ke ho. Dusre steward ko bolo."
    
    That hit me hard.
    I wasn’t expecting VIP treatment — but I didn’t expect to be humiliated just because of my designation.
    
    Another moment still echoes in my mind:
    Being a Marathi guy posted in North India, I wasn’t very fluent in Hindi grammar. One day, I casually addressed a senior as “Sharma ji.”
    He snapped back instantly, screaming:
    
    "Tumhara cadre dekho, aur mera dekho. How dare you call me Sharma ji? Call me Sharma SIR!"
    
    Excuse me?
    
    Since when did basic decency require a rank-based prefix?
    Are we in the Army or a feudal empire?
    
    Honestly, if you want to survive as a site engineer in this culture, you need two things:
    
    Learn how to abuse juniors like a senior.
    
    Learn how to tolerate abuse from your seniors like a machine.
    
    And if you’re not fluent in that toxic language, well…
    You're “too soft for this job”.
    
    Not just that — the site departments were constantly at war.
    
    EHS vs P&M vs Execution staff — arguing, blaming, fighting in WhatsApp groups like school kids.
    There was no teamwork, no collaboration — just ego clashes and blame games.
    Everyone wanted power, no one wanted responsibility.
    
    And this so-called “cadre system”?
    It felt like the corporate version of the caste system — where your post, not your potential, decided how you’d be treated.
    
    Yes — I agree that seniors deserve respect for their experience and knowledge.
    But does that give them the right to humiliate juniors?
    To ignore good ideas just because they come from “lower ranks”?
    To treat freshers like they don’t belong?
    
    Respect is earned — not inherited with a badge.
    
    And in L&T, I saw a system where professionalism meant controlling others, not empowering them.
    A system that judged you not by how well you worked — but by how low you bowed.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
     </p>

<h2>☠️ Reason 5: The Worst Working Environment</h2>
<p>This broke me.

    Let me be very clear — I’m only talking about my site, but what I experienced there was nothing short of horrific.
    
    No drinking water, no toilets, no proper food.
    
    No tea, no break, not even basic human comfort — and we were doing 12-hour shifts.
    
    Day shift had a 1-hour lunch break; night shift got none.
    
    The company promised transport from accommodation to site in the offer letter.
    But when I called the driver? I got threats, abuse, and excuses.
    
    When I complained?
    
    “Site hai, thoda sehna padta hai.”
    
    Admin department?
    Rude, unhelpful, and never acted on any complaints.
    
    And the water that was available?
    Taken from unhygienic wells — unfit for drinking — and the EHS team never even tested it.
    
    Labourers in the steel yard worked under 45°C heat without shelter.
    
    And this wasn’t a one-off — it had been happening for two years.
    
    It made me think — Even Hitler might have offered more humanity.
    </p>

<h2>🚫 Reason 6: Lack of Future Scope</h2>
<p>Even if I had chosen to stay longer, worked hard, and earned that promotion —
    the truth is: nothing significant would have changed.
    
    And that’s the real tragedy.
    
    You can’t change your work environment.
    
    You can’t escape the 12-hour shifts.
    
    You can’t break out of the construction-site loop.
    
    Even after promotion, your job nature stays the same, just with more responsibility and a marginal pay bump.
    
    What’s the point of rising in a system where:
    
    Holidays don’t exist,
    
    Personal life doesn’t matter,
    
    And the only reward for survival… is more survival?
    
    For someone who’s ambitious, driven by growth, and not afraid of taking calculated risks —
    
    staying in that loop would’ve meant burying my potential alive.
    
    That’s not just a reason —
    That’s a deal-breaker.
    </p>

<h2>🔒 Some Truths Are Still Untold…</h2>
<p>While I’ve shared the five strongest reasons behind my decision to leave L&T, let me be honest with you —

    There are still many more layers to this story.
    
    Yes, there were other reasons…
    Some deeply personal, some sensitive, some that the timing isn’t right to disclose.
    
    But I promise — when the moment is right,
    When I feel it will add value to others,
    When I can share them with full clarity and maturity —
    
    I will bring them to light.
    
    Because some truths deserve more than just a paragraph.
    They deserve their own space, their own audience, and the right time.
    
    Until then —
    Stay curious, stay bold, and never settle for less than you deserve.
